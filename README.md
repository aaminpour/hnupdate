HNUpdate  
========

Crappy script that send email updates of HN posts. When I'm busy, I can't really check HN every hour or so and some important stories get pushed to the bottom of the feed. By sending email updates periodically (this can be specified by the cronjob you define), you won't miss a single story. 

Just add it as a Cronjob and add your mail info to the script. Good to go.
